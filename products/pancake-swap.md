# Pancake Swap

## Active Vaults

Majority of the yield farming revenue is returned to users who provide capital. The remaining yield farming revenue is distributed to users who stake their BIFI in the [reward pool](https://gov.beefy.finance/stake), as well as used to pay the gas of harvests calls. A 0.1% fee is applied to all withdrawals. This is to prevent bad actors from 'gaming' the system.
