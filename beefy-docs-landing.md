# Introduction to Beefy Finance

## What is Beefy Finance?

[Beefy Finance](https://beefy.finance/) is a Decentralized, Multi-Chain Yield Optimizer platform that allows its users to earn compound interest on their crypto holdings.

Through a set of investment strategies secured and enforced by smart contracts, Beefy Finance automatically maximizes the user rewards from various liquidity pools (LPs),‌ ‌automated market making (AMM) projects,‌ ‌and‌ ‌other yield‌ farming ‌opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem. 

The main product offered by Beefy Finance are the 'Vaults' in which users stake their crypto tokens. The investment strategy tied to the specific vault will automatically increase the deposited token amount by compounding arbitrary reward tokens back into the initially deposited asset. Despite the name 'Vault' suggests, user funds are never locked in any vault on Beefy Finance: one could always withdraw from a vault at any moment in time.

DeFi applications are unique in the sense that they are permissionless and trustless, meaning that anyone with a supported wallet can interact with them without the need for a trusted middleman. While you have funds staked in a vault, you remain 100% in control of your crypto.

## What is $BIFI?

$BIFI tokens are 'dividend-eligible' revenue shares in Beefy Finance, through which holders earn profits generated by Beefy Finance and are entitled to vote on important platform decisions. 

For all the vaults deployed on every blockchain, Beefy Finance has its native governance token $BIFI at its core. Platform revenue is generated from a small percentage of all the vault profits and distributed back to those who stake $BIFI. 

The supply of $BIFI is limited at 80,000 tokens and available on the top decentralized exchanges such as Binance, 1inchexchange and PancakeSwap.
